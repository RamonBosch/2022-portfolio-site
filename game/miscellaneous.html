          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Before focussing solely on software design, <b>I worked on a handful of traditional board games</b>. These projects were my first steps towards game design. They have very diverse looks and focus on very different targets. Despite all this, I‚Äôm proud of pushing myself to work on many different styles and formats. </p>

        <h2>Castle Cluster</h2>
        <p>
          <b>A card game about destroying your opponent's castles while keeping yours safe</b>. Castle Cluster can be played one on one with a 50 card deck, and two more players can join for every extra deck, as turns happen simultaneously.
        </p>
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Castle Cluster cards" src="img/miscellaneous/ramon-bosch-game-design-castle-cluster-cards.webp">
        <p>When the turn starts, every player has to play three cards facing downwards and choose another player to target. <b>If the player's shields can't defend all attack points when the cards flip, the castles take the damage</b>. There are also five special cards that may turn the tables when played at the right time. </p>
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Diagram of a Castle Cluster campaign" src="img/miscellaneous/ramon-bosch-game-design-castle-cluster-campaign.webp">
        <h2>Traduki</h2>
        <p>A vocabulary exchange game designed so it can be customized with the two languages the player chooses. It can be played by a single player and up to four different players. <b>The players use the tokens to jump from one card to the next and try guessing the translation of the words</b> each one of them contain. </p>
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Traduki's game box content" src="img/miscellaneous/ramon-bosch-game-design-traduki-materials.webp">
        <p> If they guess right, they can keep guessing up to a maximum of three cards and get a bonus for every extra correct guess. Failing leaves the player on the same card and finishes the turn. <b>The player with the most points at the end of the game wins</b>. </p>
        <img style="max-width: 500px;" loading="lazy" alt="Traduki's card position" src="img/miscellaneous/ramon-bosch-game-design-traduki-graph.webp">
        <h2>Goal: The Match</h2>
        <p>I was commissioned to design this card game that simulates a soccer match. The <b>player is actually the coach that plans a strategy for the soccer players</b> to perform against another coach with his own set of players. </p>
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Goal: The Match cards" src="img/miscellaneous/ramon-bosch-game-design-goal-the-match-cards.webp">
        <p> Each coach has a field board and they both share a scoreboard that signals the current result and minute of the match. As for the soccer players, each one has their own position on the field, and <b>they perform better if they're in the right area</b>. </p>
